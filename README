First run maven as follows:

mvn clean install -P hpnonstop -DskipTests=true

This will bring the java and the library (.so) up to date.

Then run
mvn test 

This will run the java junit tests.

If there are difficulties with the system library, ensure that it is locatable via the _RLD_LIB_PATH environment variable 
either directly or as a symbolic link from an existing lib location such as /usr/local/lib

Enjoy!
